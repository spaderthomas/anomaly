* tasks
** done
- [X] 4/27 ImGui integration
- [X] 4/27 Use config files to configure training
- [X] 4/27 Read and write config files from ImGui
- [X] 5/18 Randomize the order of inputs
- [X] Decay the learning rate with an exponential decay

** todo
GUI changes
- [ ] Run training from ImGui
- [ ] Recompile binaries between runs
- [ ] Rewrite other steps of pipeline to accept a config file

Algorithm changes
- [ ] Be smart about seeding the RNG. You may want to use a different random device
- [ ] Split Iris into testing and training data
- [ ] Decay the neighborhood distance with an exponential decay
- [ ] Experiment with Iris dataset (remove part of a cluster, a whole cluster, etc)
